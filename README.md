# microFIM

## Overview
microFim is a Python tool for the integration of Frequent Itemset Mining into microbiome pattern analysis.
The tool is written as Python library, download with all its requirements from conda-forge website (link). 
It is built by two main modules, the tool to calculate patterns and rules and the microbiome visualization module.
Each module is available by command-line or interactive dashboard.

## Installation
1. Download Python 3 if you havenâ€™t already at https://www.python.org/
2. Clone github repository (link: https://github.com/qLSLab/microFim.git) and:
    * Download ZIP from microFIM github home page, then decompress it\
    or 
    * Use git from command line: `git clone https://github.com/qLSLab/microFim.git`

3. We suggest to install Conda or Mininconda to run microFIM - here you can find how to install Miniconda3: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

4. Once Miniconda is installed, create the conda environment with the command below: \
`conda create --name microFIM --file requirements.txt --channel default --channel conda-forge --channel plotly`

5. (Optional) Test microFIM before starting with your analysis - see Tutorial section for details

## Usage
* Guided scripts
* Python functions

### Input/output files format
Before starting, be sure to set the following requirements:
* #ID \
In the taxa table, the column describing taxa must be filled as #ID. You can rename it with `sed -i 's/SEARCH_REGEX/REPLACEMENT/g' INPUTFILE` \
or a text editor
* #SampleID \
If you want to filter your taxa table with a list of samples or metadata file, the column name must be filled as #SampleID 
* CSV/TSV format \
Taxa table, metadata file and sample list file must be provided as CSV or TSV. Template file is already defined as CSV in input_templates directory on this Github repository.
